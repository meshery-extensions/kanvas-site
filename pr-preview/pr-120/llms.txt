# Kanvas

> Visual, real-time collaborative cloud native infrastructure design and management platform by Layer5.

Kanvas (often described as "Google Docs for infrastructure") provides a multiplayer canvas where platform engineers, DevOps teams, and developers can collaborate on architecture maps, Kubernetes topologies, and cloud patterns in real-time. It replaces manual YAML configuration with an intuitive drag-and-drop experience.

## Core Capabilities
- **Designer Mode**: Model cloud native infrastructure visually using a component catalog.
- **Operator Mode**: Manage live Kubernetes clusters and monitor performance from the canvas.
- **Multiplayer Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user design sessions.
- **390+ Integrations**: Supports Kubernetes, Helm, AWS, GCP, Azure, Istio, Prometheus, and more.
- **GitOps & CI/CD**: Visual reviews for version-controlled designs and deployment dry-runs.
- **Observability**: Interactive terminal sessions and timeline DVR for deployment history.
